WIP

EZGPT is a project I am working on for a simple, local GPT chat enviroment with memory practically out the box.

I am trying my best to adhere to the KISS method while developing this project further.

By using the API over the web interface, you stand to save significant amounts of money depending on your use case. How you use this program and the costs associated are YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. Please use your best judgement.

Currently, chat context is simply stored in an array, which is passed along with your new messges. The result is an extremely simple, but accurate, ChatGPT chat application.

You must edit the script to use your own key, it is recommended you use an enviroment variable.

The API key in the initial commit is invalid.
